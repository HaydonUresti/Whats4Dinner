# Whats4Dinner

An app to help you keep track of what's for dinner the week.

# Overview

Whats4Dinner is a note app for dinner. It allows you to enter what the meal is, as well as a helpful note or description
relating to the meal. This data is saved locally on your device in order to be viewable when re-opening the app. Whats4Dinner has not been tested on IOS

### Use-

In order to use the app, after downloading the source code and dependencies, download Expo Go on your Android phone. Then run the command 'expo start --tunnel' and follow the instruction that follow. Alternatively, open an Android emulator, run the same command as before, then enter the 'a' key into the terminal.

When the app is opened click on the desired day to plan a meal for, and a note screen will appear. Enter what the meal is on the line that says 'Meal'. Then, if desired, enter notes relating to the meal. This could be instructions, needed ingredients, or anything else you would like!

After you enter what you need, press SAVE NOTE, which will save data to your device. If needed the EXIT button may be pressed to leave the note. When done, entered info will stay until the app is closed.

-IMPORTANT- If a data is saved in a note, the CLEAR NOTE button must be used before anything else is added to the note.

## Purpose

My purpose in creating Whats4Dinner was to learn how to use React Native and explore mobile app development, while creating something that would be useful to me.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the app running and a walkthrough of the code.}
